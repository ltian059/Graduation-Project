This is an example application showing the Bluetooth LE communication between the MAXREFDES104 and a PC console application.

This project was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 in C# and built with .NET Framework 4.7.2.

The solution contains two projects one RD104BleApi and RD104ConsoleApp. The RD104BleApi project is based upon the MAXREFDES104 HSP 3.0 Host BLE API document. The API works with the Cypress BLE dongle. The RD104ConsoleApp is a console application showing how to use the commands of the API together and to process the received data.
