3 experiments are conducted by two subjets.

Experiment 1: Breathe normally for 1 minute.

Experiment 2: Breathe 15 seconds and hold breath 15 seconds; Repeat until 1 minute.

Experiment 3: Tide Breathe for 15 seconds and hold breath 15 seconds; Repeat until 1 minute.

LED2_PPG utilizes Red light to measure data. Red light might be better than green light in terms of extracting breathing signals. 
So I also provided sliding windows for the LED2_PPG data plots.
