# SpO2

Maximâ€™s proprietary algorithms for deriving clinical-grade accuracy pulse oximetry (SpO2) measurements from **Red and IR** PPG signals.

The algorithm uses the default settings for PPG measurements 2 and 3. Measurement 2 drives the IR (LED2) LED, and Measurement 3 drives the Red (LED1) LED. Both measurements sample PD1.

# Heart Rate

The HR algorithm uses the default PPG settings for measurement 1, which drives the Green (LED1) and samples PD2 and PD3.
